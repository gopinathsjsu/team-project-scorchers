## Procedure to run the project:

### Pre-requisites to run the project:
1. Database browser for SQLite. You can download this here - https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
2. Python v3.6.7 or higher. (This project is built in python v3.6.7)
3. Code editor like Visual Studio code. You can download the vs code here - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

After meeting all the pre-requisites mentioned above please follow the below steps to run the code.
1. Download/clone the project repository.
2. Open the command prompt in the /airport_management_system directory.
3. Create a virtual environment and install django here. Please follow this link to do so - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment
4. Once this is done you are good to go and can explore the application by typing the command 
> python manage.py runserver
5. This will give you an IP address. Copy and paste this in the web browser and the home.html gets rendered.

## Design Decisons

### Database

Reasons to choose a SQLite Database
- SQLite databases can be queried and stored in a structured manner. The data retrieval is much more robust and it shows higher performance rate.
- The application file is portable across all operating systems, 32-bit and 64-bit and big- and little-endian architectures.
- Content can be accessed and updated using powerful SQL queries, greatly reducing the complexity of the application code.
- Content stored in an SQLite database is more likely to be recoverable decades in the future, long after all traces of the original application have been lost.
  Data lives longer than code.

### Backend

Reasons to choose Django web framework
- Django has the Model View Template Architecture which is a software design pattern. This web framework  is written in python.
- When we create web applications in Django, it makes sure that developers don’t commit any mistakes related to security.
- Django is scalable in nature and has ability to quickly and flexibly switch from small to large scale application project.
- It allows to build applications for different-different domains. Main features of Django are rapid development, fully loaded, vast and supported community.
- We wanted to do our project in Python, so we decided Django as Backend and pythonanywhere for cloud deployment.

### Frontend

Reasons to choose HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- For better user experience we are using the most common frontend languages - HTML, CSS, JavaScript for our project.

## Deployment

Reasons to choose pythonanywhere for cloud deployment
- Pythonanywhere cloud provider is the best suitable one for the frameworks like Django
- It has extra flexibility to work from anywhere
- It provides lots of pre-installed python libraries which makes our work more smooth
