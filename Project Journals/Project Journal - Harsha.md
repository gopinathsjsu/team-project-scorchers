# XP Core Value Followed :

# Communication 
* The XP value that we have used during the sprints meetings is communication throughout the project development.
* All the team members have communicated well through all sprints. 
* Sprint meetings were held on every Monday at 7:30pm

# Feedback
We constantly had mid-week meetings to check the work that was done and gave constructive feedback if required.
We also conducted Sprint restrospective at the end of the week to discuss what went well, what could be improved.

# Respect
We conducted our meetings, discussion professionally having respect towards each other.
We values everyone's opinion in the project and setup a meeting to discuss whenever there is a conflict of opinion.
